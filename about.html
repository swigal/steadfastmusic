                <p >Ever since I began working in worship and music ministries at church, the word steadfast has been one word I kept coming back to.  According to dictionary.com, steadfast means to be fixed or firm in a direction or purpose – unwavering. The the word for steadfast in the original Hebrew is chesed (pronounced kheh’-sed) and it refers to God’s devout loving-kindness, mercy, and faithfulness at the very core of His character and actions.
    
                <p>God is steadfast. Therefore, His love is steadfast – unwavering, faithful, and kind.</p>
    
                <p>As we step out in faith, defending what we we believe, defending the Scriptures, we are embodying the very meaning of steadfast.  We are standing firm, resolute, unwavering on the scriptures.  We are place our faith in God.  We remain steadfast in God's grace and love, revealing His Word, Jesus Christ, to the world we serve in, with the goal to bring everyone into fellowship.  God will always remain steadfast in his love for us. So, we must remain steadfast in our love for him.  ~ Samuel Wigal <i>(September 2024)</i></p>

                <h1 class="pb-3">Where We Started</h1>
                <p>Steadfast Music Ministry officially began in September of 2024.  Samuel Wigal joined Pastors Cindy and Stacy to plant a brand new Global Methodist church in Parkersburg, West Virginia.  Revelation Fellowship held its inaugural worship service at 10:45 am on July 28th, 2025 in the Family Center at Leavitt's Funeral Home, but quickly found a dedicataed facility at 2807 Murdoch Avenue.  Steadfast Music Ministries began after the church moved into this facility and had completed the renovations to transform it into a brand new place of worship.</p>

                <p>What started as a few simple meetings to determine who wanted to be onvolved and what our ministry would look like, turned into what we have today.  Focused primarily on traditional choir, we lead our congregation in praise and worship two Sundays each month and special services.</p>

                <p>In November of 2025, Pastor Mark Zimmer, of Rockland Church in Belpre, OH, reached out to Cindy and Stacy to get to know the other <abbr title="Global Methodist Church">GMC</abbr> pastor's in the area and discuss how we may be able to work together in the future to expand the ministries of both churches.  Cindy left that meeting stating, "I will reach out to you in two weeks."  Three days later, members of Revelation Fellowship began "scoping the place out."  Cindy had an idea that was quickly running out of control.  "Could our two churches, Rockland and Revelation Fellowship, join together, combine resources, and build an even stronger ministry?"</p>
